Gallbladder Points
The Gallbladder meridian begins at the outer canthus of the eye, traverses the lateral aspect of the head and neck, passes through the shoulder region, descends along the lateral aspect of the trunk and hindlimb, and terminates at the fourth toe. This meridian aids in decision-making, regulates tendons and joints, and supports bile production.
