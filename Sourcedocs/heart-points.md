Heart Points
The Heart meridian originates in the heart, travels through the chest, emerges at the axilla, and flows along the caudomedial aspect of the forelimb to end at the medial corner of the coronary band of the front hoof. The meridian is associated with blood circulation, consciousness, and mental-emotional states.
