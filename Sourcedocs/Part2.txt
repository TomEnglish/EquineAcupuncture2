Spleen Points


Hind foot to flank 
The Spleen meridian begins at the medial aspect of the hind hoof, travels up the medial aspect of the distal hind limb, tracks cranial over the tibia, then crosses the medial aspect of the stifle, emerging at the flank fold (SP-10) to the cranioventral tuber coxae (SP-11).
