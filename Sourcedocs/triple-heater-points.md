Triple Heater Points
The Triple Heater meridian (also known as Triple Burner or San Jiao) begins at the lateral aspect of the ring finger, runs up the dorsolateral aspect of the forelimb to the shoulder, then along the neck to the face, ending at the lateral aspect of the eyebrow. This meridian regulates the functions of the three "burning spaces" (upper, middle, and lower jiao) and the movement of fluids throughout the body.
