Small Intestine Points
The Small Intestine meridian begins at the lateral coronary band of the forelimb, travels up the lateral aspect of the limb to the scapula, continues to the neck and face, and terminates at the ear. This meridian aids in the separation of clear from turbid substances, supports mental clarity, and influences hearing.
